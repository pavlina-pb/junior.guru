Bonus \n* \ud83d\udd58 Partial day overlap EST\n* \ud83d\udd11 Work with the Founders\n* \ud83d\udca1 3-7 Years of Experience\n* \ud83d\uddfa Anywhere in the United States or Europe\n\n**Get Paid**: If you recommend this job to the person that gets hired, we will give you a $350 referral bonus! How will we contact you about giving you your bonus? Tell your referral to list your name and\/or email in the \u201cHow did you hear about this job?\u201d question. Once they\u2019re hired, we\u2019ll make sure you get paid.\n\n## Summary\n\nInvergHQ is Hiring a Full Stack Developer as their second technical hire. They\u2019ll be working directly with the CTO and the other founders. This is an opportunity to be an early hire, work in all parts of the system, and help a fast-growing business go to the next level.\n\n## Who We Are\n\nAt its core, [Inverge](https:\/\/invergehq.com\/) is a platform that helps brands and wholesalers connect with their retailers and gives everyone the tools they need to sell more easily and efficiently.\n\nOur users are able to have one tool to get their products in the hands of customers anywhere they are with minimal effort. They can dive in deep and run every aspect of their business or just use a single piece. This could be a brand connecting to thousands of retailers across the country for both drop shipping and replenishment, sharing a single uniform catalog, managing all of their warehousing and fulfillment for orders coming from any channel; be that a retailer, B2B website, marketplace, or B2C website. This could also be a small store looking to simplify its inventory management and understand its customers better.\n\nOur existing team is composed of three founders. All are based in the areas surrounding New York City.\n\nSince our soft launch, we\u2019ve been able to attract well-known brands and as we gear up for a formal launch and an aggressive marketing\/sales initiative, we\u2019re expanding our team.\n\nWe are preparing to grow rapidly and are looking for the right person to join us. This will be a critical role in our technology growth and will work directly with the Co-Founder and CTO.\n\nHaving your hands in all parts of the system, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to build a team around you and shape how we serve our users.\n\n## About the Role\n\nThis is an opportunity to face a variety of challenges and find what excites you.\n\nIf you love data, analyzing it, and building algorithms to make peoples\u2019 lives easier, there are tons of opportunities for that.\n\nIf you love communicating with different APIs and bringing information together, the opportunities are virtually limitless.\n\nIf you love taking things apart and seeing how you can make them work better or simplify things, there is plenty of opportunity for that.\n\nIf you love solving problems we are a team that loves to find the hardest problems and work together to solve them.\n\nOur team is curious and always looking to grow and learn.\n\nYou\u2019ll have your hands in the entire system. This will include updating and optimizing existing features, fixing bugs, and developing new features.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be critical in our transition to a serverless API-based architecture and will be facilitating that process. You\u2019ll have an important role in implementing the standards and procedures needed for collaboration as we grow our development team.\n\nThe job will start full-time and from the beginning you\u2019ll be working closely with the CTO to be trained on the usage of the in-house built PHP MVC dependency injection framework that the main application is built on. Once a fundamental understanding is reached, you\u2019ll jump right in on projects that need to be addressed right away which will grow in complexity as their experience grows.\n\nThis hire we\u2019re making will be the second technical member on the team and will play a critical role in the initial growth of the company. You\u2019ll be working with the entire founding team but primarily with the CTO.\n\nIn the beginning, you\u2019ll be working primarily with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery. This will transition into primarily Node.js and Serverless Framework replacing the PHP. To a lesser extent at the beginning, you will also be working with React and React Native. You will be building on AWS using EC2, RDS, Elasticache, Lambda, and API Gateway. The collaboration will happen using Git (Bitbucket), Jira, and Trello.\n\nOur day-to-day direct communication is through Slack and email. We manage projects and the roadmap using Trello and Jira. We manage the codebase using Bitbucket.\n\nThe start date is as soon as possible. We are beginning to scale and need to grow our team to continue the development of and maintain our current platform.\n\n## Projects and Day to Day Work\n\nThere is a significant amount of autonomy. There are clear goals and priorities but the actual implementation and timing are flexible. For the most part, our new hire is expected to be self-motivated and complete their work. You\u2019ll have access to the rest of the team as needed but shouldn\u2019t expect to be babysat as long as their work is being completed.\n\nA majority of your time initially will be spent working on the existing PHP\/MySQL application. We have many features that need to be added on an ongoing basis. There are also numerous areas that need optimization or tweaks to simplify support. This will range from developing stand-alone applications such as activity tracking across the entire application to adding an interface for changing the comparison date on a sales dashboard to debugging image ordering in existing API integration to developing an entirely new API integration for managing products, inventory, and orders. That initial work will transition to developing these features in the serverless architecture using Node.js.\n\nWe are in the process of exposing the entire application via API. A major part of this role will be assisting in this transition, slowly swapping out the PHP backend with a new implementation in Node.js. You would be expected to have good fundamentals and ability to code in PHP but primarily be experienced in and interested in Node development.\n\n## Long Term and Growth\n\nIn the long term, this person will be managing a team, setting priorities, and overseeing development.\n\nYou will have the opportunity to work with a variety of languages and frameworks. You will not be expected to know everything but show a track record of being curious and wanting to learn. There will be a lot of opportunities to find the projects that you find the most interesting, be it integrating with different APIs or optimizing AWS infrastructure, or developing Native modules. You are coming into a company with a solid foundation at a time when everything is being looked at for improvement. You will hopefully have a huge say in how things are structured and how projects are prioritized.\n\n## Who You Are\n\nWe are looking for someone who is self-motivated and ready to take initiative. We are not looking for someone who needs to be told what to do on a daily basis. We are looking for someone who loves solving problems but doesn\u2019t always go with the first thing that comes to mind. You also consider how this solution might be able to solve the next problem too while being mindful of when spending more time on something in the short term is appropriate. You will be working in a rapidly changing environment and will not be expected to know everything but be very interested in learning new things. You\u2019ll be expected to have worked on teams in production environments and bring their experience and best practices to aid us in this growth period.\n\n## Required Skills\n\n* PHP\n* Node.js\n* Typescript\n* MySQL\n* HTML\/CSS\/jQuery\n* Linux\n\n## Nice to Have Skills\n\n* TypeORM\n* Express\n* React\/React Native\n* Serverless\n\n## Required Experience\n\n* API integrations\n* Using existing SDK as well as from the ground up\n* Decent UI\/UX skills\u2013by no means Rembrandt but able to make things logical to use and good to look at\n* Standard Git use\n* Experience deploying and maintaining production applications on AWS\n* EC2\n* RDS\n* ELB\n* S3\n* Lambda\n* API Gateway\n\nBackground in eCommerce or understanding of retail is a big plus. We are always needing to put ourselves in the shoes of our clients to figure out the best way to solve the next problem and if you don\u2019t know what an SKU or a PO is it\u2019ll be hard to do that.\n\nLocation: At least a partial day overlap with a standard EST workday.\n\nIf you think you\u2019d be a good fit, we\u2019d love to hear from you!\n\nInverge asks respectfully to only apply through the application form and do not email\/apply directly to Inverge.

They’ll be working directly with the CTO and the other founders. This is an opportunity to be an early hire, work in all parts of the system, and help a fast-growing business go to the next level.\n\n## Who We Are\n\nAt its core, [Inverge](https://invergehq.com/) is a platform that helps brands and wholesalers connect with their retailers and gives everyone the tools they need to sell more easily and efficiently.\n\nOur users are able to have one tool to get their products in the hands of customers anywhere they are with minimal effort. They can dive in deep and run every aspect of their business or just use a single piece. This could be a brand connecting to thousands of retailers across the country for both drop shipping and replenishment, sharing a single uniform catalog, managing all of their warehousing and fulfillment for orders coming from any channel; be that a retailer, B2B website, marketplace, or B2C website. This could also be a small store looking to simplify its inventory management and understand its customers better.\n\nOur existing team is composed of three founders. All are based in the areas surrounding New York City.\n\nSince our soft launch, we’ve been able to attract well-known brands and as we gear up for a formal launch and an aggressive marketing/sales initiative, we’re expanding our team.\n\nWe are preparing to grow rapidly and are looking for the right person to join us. This will be a critical role in our technology growth and will work directly with the Co-Founder and CTO.\n\nHaving your hands in all parts of the system, you’ll have an opportunity to build a team around you and shape how we serve our users.\n\n## About the Role\n\nThis is an opportunity to face a variety of challenges and find what excites you.\n\nIf you love data, analyzing it, and building algorithms to make peoples’ lives easier, there are tons of opportunities for that.\n\nIf you love communicating with different APIs and bringing information together, the opportunities are virtually limitless.\n\nIf you love taking things apart and seeing how you can make them work better or simplify things, there is plenty of opportunity for that.\n\nIf you love solving problems we are a team that loves to find the hardest problems and work together to solve them.\n\nOur team is curious and always looking to grow and learn.\n\nYou’ll have your hands in the entire system. This will include updating and optimizing existing features, fixing bugs, and developing new features.\n\nYou’ll also be critical in our transition to a serverless API-based architecture and will be facilitating that process. You’ll have an important role in implementing the standards and procedures needed for collaboration as we grow our development team.\n\nThe job will start full-time and from the beginning you’ll be working closely with the CTO to be trained on the usage of the in-house built PHP MVC dependency injection framework that the main application is built on. Once a fundamental understanding is reached, you’ll jump right in on projects that need to be addressed right away which will grow in complexity as their experience grows.\n\nThis hire we’re making will be the second technical member on the team and will play a critical role in the initial growth of the company. You’ll be working with the entire founding team but primarily with the CTO.\n\nIn the beginning, you’ll be working primarily with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery. This will transition into primarily Node.js and Serverless Framework replacing the PHP. To a lesser extent at the beginning, you will also be working with React and React Native. You will be building on AWS using EC2, RDS, Elasticache, Lambda, and API Gateway. The collaboration will happen using Git (Bitbucket), Jira, and Trello.\n\nOur day-to-day direct communication is through Slack and email. We manage projects and the roadmap using Trello and Jira. We manage the codebase using Bitbucket.\n\nThe start date is as soon as possible. We are beginning to scale and need to grow our team to continue the development of and maintain our current platform.\n\n## Projects and Day to Day Work\n\nThere is a significant amount of autonomy. There are clear goals and priorities but the actual implementation and timing are flexible. For the most part, our new hire is expected to be self-motivated and complete their work.
