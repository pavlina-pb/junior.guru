control room operators should have better tools to perform their daily jobs. Control room operations directly impact the safety, environmental performance, and bottom-line revenue of energy companies. We thought if pilots have auto-pilot software, why don\u2019t control room operators? If you are interested in working on something that isn't a web app, or with ads, but affects the physical world, please read on.\u00a0\n\nCrux OCM is a venture-backed company on a mission to enhance safety and efficiency in control room operations starting with the $87.5 trillion dollar oil and gas industry through industrial process automation. Although we are a young company, our team is comprised of industry veterans that have already made their mark in control systems, commissioning, and advanced process control. In two short years we have progressed from concept, to MVP, to commercial-scale Proof of Concepts and deployments.\u00a0We are proud to help energy companies operate in the safest, and most efficient way possible.\u00a0\n\nWhy Join Us\u00a0\n\nWe are looking for software engineers who are intrinsically motivated and passionate about improving efficiency in the energy industry. As a part of our smart, ambitious team, you will help Crux OCM scale as the first mover in this market. We are not everyone\u2019s ideal workplace. We thrive on change, operate on trust, and leverage our team\u2019s diverse perspectives in everything we do. We solve problems at a rapid pace and challenge the status quo. In short, we get stuff done. We provide the tools necessary to be effective in our environment and provide continuous learning opportunities and mentorship. Our goal is to provide the opportunity for each of our employees to be at the forefront of the energy industry\u2019s rapid digital transformation.\u00a0\n\nWhat We Are Looking For\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re growing and looking for an experienced Software Engineer to join our Team. In this role you will work on the software development team building our core software product for automated control room operations. Your Software Development experience will be used to further the product vision by working closely with the dev, installation, CTO, and product team to set Crux OCM up to expand its product lines and scale.\n\n\u00a0We are looking for someone who is interested in applying their knowledge in new ways to advance Robotic Industrial Process Automation adoption into energy, followed by broader heavy industry adoption.\u00a0\n\nThe ideal candidate thrives on change, operates on trust, and embraces our team\u2019s diverse perspectives to tackle complex problems. We solve problems at a rapid pace and challenge the status quo. We are very open to remote candidates!\n\nThe Impact You Will Have\n\u00a0\nBe a key contributor ensuing successful product delivery for customers and enhancing the functionality of the Crux OCM platform. Given that we are an early stage start-up, there is plenty of room to grow into many career opportunities. You will be free to work without organizational or legacy friction.\n\u00a0\nIn this role, you will report directly to our lead software engineer and will work closely with the CTO, Sales Team, Software Development Team, Commissioning Team in a matrix organization structure. This is a remote role.\n\u00a0\nWorst Part of The Job\n\u00a0\nThe worst part of working for Crux OCM at this stage will be the lack of established processes. We are relying on our early team to define, build and establish the processes we need to scale rapidly. If you require a highly structured environment, then this role is likely not for you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt Crux, we believe in taking care of each other by offering benefits that actually benefit you. Here are some of the ways we do that:\n\u00a0\nWhat We Offer\n\u00a0\nYou Can Plan For Your Future: We offer competitive compensation packages and health benefits as we strongly believe in investing in our employees. Additionally, through our Employee Stock Option Plan, all of the Crux family becomes shareholders in the company.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA Trust-Based, Flexible Workplace: We want you to come in and put in your solid work, but when the workday is over \u2014 go live your life, rest, and recharge.

Control room operations directly impact the safety, environmental performance, and bottom-line revenue of energy companies. We thought if pilots have auto-pilot software, why don’t control room operators? If you are interested in working on something that isn't a web app, or with ads, but affects the physical world, please read on. \n\nCrux OCM is a venture-backed company on a mission to enhance safety and efficiency in control room operations starting with the $87.5 trillion dollar oil and gas industry through industrial process automation. Although we are a young company, our team is comprised of industry veterans that have already made their mark in control systems, commissioning, and advanced process control. In two short years we have progressed from concept, to MVP, to commercial-scale Proof of Concepts and deployments. We are proud to help energy companies operate in the safest, and most efficient way possible. \n\nWhy Join Us \n\nWe are looking for software engineers who are intrinsically motivated and passionate about improving efficiency in the energy industry. As a part of our smart, ambitious team, you will help Crux OCM scale as the first mover in this market. We are not everyone’s ideal workplace. We thrive on change, operate on trust, and leverage our team’s diverse perspectives in everything we do. We solve problems at a rapid pace and challenge the status quo. In short, we get stuff done. We provide the tools necessary to be effective in our environment and provide continuous learning opportunities and mentorship. Our goal is to provide the opportunity for each of our employees to be at the forefront of the energy industry’s rapid digital transformation. \n\nWhat We Are Looking For \n\nWe’re growing and looking for an experienced Software Engineer to join our Team. In this role you will work on the software development team building our core software product for automated control room operations. Your Software Development experience will be used to further the product vision by working closely with the dev, installation, CTO, and product team to set Crux OCM up to expand its product lines and scale.\n\n We are looking for someone who is interested in applying their knowledge in new ways to advance Robotic Industrial Process Automation adoption into energy, followed by broader heavy industry adoption. \n\nThe ideal candidate thrives on change, operates on trust, and embraces our team’s diverse perspectives to tackle complex problems. We solve problems at a rapid pace and challenge the status quo. We are very open to remote candidates!\n\nThe Impact You Will Have\n \nBe a key contributor ensuing successful product delivery for customers and enhancing the functionality of the Crux OCM platform. Given that we are an early stage start-up, there is plenty of room to grow into many career opportunities. You will be free to work without organizational or legacy friction.\n \nIn this role, you will report directly to our lead software engineer and will work closely with the CTO, Sales Team, Software Development Team, Commissioning Team in a matrix organization structure. This is a remote role.\n \nWorst Part of The Job\n \nThe worst part of working for Crux OCM at this stage will be the lack of established processes. We are relying on our early team to define, build and establish the processes we need to scale rapidly. If you require a highly structured environment, then this role is likely not for you. \n \nAt Crux, we believe in taking care of each other by offering benefits that actually benefit you. Here are some of the ways we do that:\n \nWhat We Offer\n \nYou Can Plan For Your Future: We offer competitive compensation packages and health benefits as we strongly believe in investing in our employees. Additionally, through our Employee Stock Option Plan, all of the Crux family becomes shareholders in the company. \n \nA Trust-Based, Flexible Workplace: We want you to come in and put in your solid work, but when the workday is over — go live your life, rest, and recharge. Come in (or work remotely) and leave when you need to — your results are your results.\n \n You’re inspired to Grow: Embrace a culture of learning and attend workshops, team building events, and educational presentations. \n \nRelocation Support. We go above in beyond when we identify great talent. Therefore, we sponsor visas and offer relocation support to help get you here. We will help you every step of the way in getting you to your new location and settled in.\n \nWe have fun: Get to know your colleagues through events, happy hour, or simply chatting over snacks.
