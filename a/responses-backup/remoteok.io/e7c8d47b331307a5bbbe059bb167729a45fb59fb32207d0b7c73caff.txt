a mid-level or senior software engineer to join our development team. You\u2019ll be part of a small, agile group that\u2019s building and managing the fastest-growing social networks for people living with chronic health conditions. We are full-stack developers building both hybrid mobile apps and back-end services.\n\nOur native apps are built with Ionic\/Apache Cordova + Angular. Our back-end stack is built around Ruby on Rails, Foundation, jQuery, and MongoDB running on AWS.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for developers with some experience in any of these core technologies, and with a readiness to learn and grow in others.\n\n### What We\u2019re Looking For:\n\n* 4+ years experience with any of these: Ruby on Rails, Ionic\/Apache Cordova, Javascript\/jQuery, Angular\nFamiliarity with TDD\/BDD\n* Love of clean code\n* Willingness to work on every part of the stack. Everything from native app development and full-stack Rails development to DevOps\n* Motivation to work on something that makes a difference\n* Bonus points for Zurb Foundation or Elasticsearch\n\nThis is a full-time position. Due to COVID-19, it is a remote position; however, if\/when we can go back to an office environment, you will have the opportunity to work in our downtown San Francisco office or our midtown Sacramento office. Option to work remotely in the states in which MHT operates is possible for the right candidate. We are offering a great opportunity to make a difference in the healthcare space. \n\n### About Us\n\n* Our corporate headquarters is in San Francisco. We have an office in Sacramento and teams on both the West and East Coasts.\n* Everyone here believes in the company mission, and we are committed to serving people facing chronic conditions.\n* A close-knit, hard-working company where everyone respects everyone else\u2019s contribution to our success.\n* We truly care about our employees and value a healthy work-life balance to ensure nobody burns out or feels overworked. A few of the ways we put this into action:\n1. Every month during the pandemic, there has been at least one company-paid holiday (and we\u2019re planning to continue that into the future).\n2. We don\u2019t deploy to production on Fridays, because if anything goes wrong, we don\u2019t want anyone working over the weekend.\n3. We respect the working hours in your time zone. So regardless of where you\u2019re located, work the hours that are best for you (as long as there is some overlap with the Pacific Time working day).\n* At MyHealthTeams, we believe in investing in people with diverse experiences and backgrounds to help improve the lives of people facing chronic health conditions. To do this, we seek to:\n1. Attract and hire a diverse workforce\n2. Cultivate an environment where colleagues feel welcomed and supported\n3. Nurture the professional growth of employees\n\n### A Few Perks\n\n* Unlimited PTO\n* Competitive pay, benefits, and equity\n* 100% remote option\n\n### Company Vision\n\nMyHealthTeams is a 60+ person mission-driven company that creates social networks for people facing chronic health conditions. We believe that if you\u2019re diagnosed with a disease such as MS, lupus, breast cancer, or diabetes (to name a few), it should be easy to find support, trusted information, and the best people around to help you. With social networks in 41 different chronic conditions and over 2.5 million members, MyHealthTeams is the fastest-growing social network in chronic health. Three years from now, if you\u2019re diagnosed with a chronic condition, we believe your doctor will prescribe one of our social networks because being engaged in one of them will actually improve health outcomes. We develop partnerships that empower and are transparent to our members.

You’ll be part of a small, agile group that’s building and managing the fastest-growing social networks for people living with chronic health conditions. We are full-stack developers building both hybrid mobile apps and back-end services.\n\nOur native apps are built with Ionic/Apache Cordova + Angular. Our back-end stack is built around Ruby on Rails, Foundation, jQuery, and MongoDB running on AWS.\n\nWe’re looking for developers with some experience in any of these core technologies, and with a readiness to learn and grow in others.\n\n### What We’re Looking For:\n\n* 4+ years experience with any of these: Ruby on Rails, Ionic/Apache Cordova, Javascript/jQuery, Angular\nFamiliarity with TDD/BDD\n* Love of clean code\n* Willingness to work on every part of the stack. Everything from native app development and full-stack Rails development to DevOps\n* Motivation to work on something that makes a difference\n* Bonus points for Zurb Foundation or Elasticsearch\n\nThis is a full-time position. Due to COVID-19, it is a remote position; however, if/when we can go back to an office environment, you will have the opportunity to work in our downtown San Francisco office or our midtown Sacramento office. Option to work remotely in the states in which MHT operates is possible for the right candidate. We are offering a great opportunity to make a difference in the healthcare space. \n\n### About Us\n\n* Our corporate headquarters is in San Francisco. We have an office in Sacramento and teams on both the West and East Coasts.\n* Everyone here believes in the company mission, and we are committed to serving people facing chronic conditions.\n* A close-knit, hard-working company where everyone respects everyone else’s contribution to our success.\n* We truly care about our employees and value a healthy work-life balance to ensure nobody burns out or feels overworked. A few of the ways we put this into action:\n1. Every month during the pandemic, there has been at least one company-paid holiday (and we’re planning to continue that into the future).\n2. We don’t deploy to production on Fridays, because if anything goes wrong, we don’t want anyone working over the weekend.\n3. We respect the working hours in your time zone. So regardless of where you’re located, work the hours that are best for you (as long as there is some overlap with the Pacific Time working day).\n* At MyHealthTeams, we believe in investing in people with diverse experiences and backgrounds to help improve the lives of people facing chronic health conditions. To do this, we seek to:\n1. Attract and hire a diverse workforce\n2. Cultivate an environment where colleagues feel welcomed and supported\n3. Nurture the professional growth of employees\n\n### A Few Perks\n\n* Unlimited PTO\n* Competitive pay, benefits, and equity\n* 100% remote option\n\n### Company Vision\n\nMyHealthTeams is a 60+ person mission-driven company that creates social networks for people facing chronic health conditions. We believe that if you’re diagnosed with a disease such as MS, lupus, breast cancer, or diabetes (to name a few), it should be easy to find support, trusted information, and the best people around to help you. With social networks in 41 different chronic conditions and over 2.5 million members, MyHealthTeams is the fastest-growing social network in chronic health. Three years from now, if you’re diagnosed with a chronic condition, we believe your doctor will prescribe one of our social networks because being engaged in one of them will actually improve health outcomes. We develop partnerships that empower and are transparent to our members. We believe that a business can “do good” while “doing well.”	\n\nBe sure to mention the words **SHIP CANAL TRIM** when applying to show you read the job post completely.
