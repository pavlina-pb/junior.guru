We're modernizing education by helping those new to the tech industry get real, practical experience on-the-job instead of in the classroom. Our goal is to provide access to opportunities to people who otherwise would have been overlooked by the traditional interview process.\n\n\nWe have revolutionized the technical interview process by using a practical work simulation to assess candidates instead of relying on credentials, years of experience, or impractical CS knowledge to assess candidates.\n\n\nHatchways is a place you come to make an impact, working with like-minded people to build something meaningful using the best technology. You can read more about our team and culture here - https:\/\/hatchways.io\/careers.\n\n\nWhat we are looking for?\n\nWe are adding a Senior Full-stack Engineer to the team. As a member of the team, you will get a chance to develop complex web applications, using a mix of Javascript (React) and Python. You will be working in a highly collaborative environment. This is an exciting role for someone who enjoys the challenge and responsibility for large projects.\n\n\nWhat does senior mean? For us, we are a company that doesn\u2019t hire based on years of experience or credentials. In order to be senior, we are looking for an engineer that can provide technical mentorship to our team and can work on complex technical projects with little to no direction.\n\n\nThe ideal candidate for this position is a thoughtful problem solver who can easily adapt to changing requirements and quickly learn new technologies. They are passionate about developing modern, cutting-edge web applications, and can balance empathy to end-users with technical requirements.\n\n\nWhat you hopefully bring:\n\nExperience with a modern front-end framework (React, Angular, Vue, Ember, Typescript) and back-end framework (Python, Rails, Node.js)\nOur stack is React, Python\/Flask, GCP\nExperience with non-relational or relational databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra\nExperience working with IaaS such as GCP or AWS\nExperience giving feedback on others' code through code reviews\n\nAbout you:\n\nA positive attitude, motivated, and a fast learner\nYou love teamwork and find it easy to collaborate closely with the engineering team to solve complex problems in efficient and scalable ways\nYou have a passion for solving problems across all areas of the business\nExcited with the opportunity to lead a small team!\n\nInterview process:\n\nA 30-minute phone call with our CTO (https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shumskassam\/)\nA project-based assessment where you will work on a few issues on a Github repository - it will be very practical and done using React + Python\nA final 30-minute culture fit call with our CEO (https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jaclynling\/)\n\nWhat are the perks and benefits?\n\nWe are a flexible, diverse, and remote-friendly team. We prioritize learning and growth opportunities for our developers (not only technically, but also personally) through frequent 1:1 meetings with your managers, valuable quarterly reviews, and external training opportunities. We are an early-stage startup, so joining us early means you will have a significant stake in the company. We also have a very flexible vacation and health benefits plan.\n\n\nLearn a little more about the founding team:\n\nHatchways is a Y Combinator-backed startup (S19) and is founded by two-time founders Jaclyn and Shums. Prior to starting Hatchways, Jaclyn and Shums started their first startup (Blynk, your personal stylist in your pocket) which got acquired by Kik (popular messenger app in Waterloo, ON). At Kik, Shums was an engineering manager and Jaclyn led product for the bots team. Together, they launched some of the first chatbots in the market with partners like H&M, Sephora, and Shopify. Shortly thereafter, they wanted to pursue a problem area they were passionate about: improving the education to employment pathways so more people have access to opportunities in tech.\n\n\nHatchways is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. If there is any part of the interview process that is not accommodating for your situation, we are more than happy to create a more comfortable process for you.

We're modernizing education by helping those new to the tech industry get real, practical experience on-the-job instead of in the classroom. Our goal is to provide access to opportunities to people who otherwise would have been overlooked by the traditional interview process.\n\n\nWe have revolutionized the technical interview process by using a practical work simulation to assess candidates instead of relying on credentials, years of experience, or impractical CS knowledge to assess candidates.\n\n\nHatchways is a place you come to make an impact, working with like-minded people to build something meaningful using the best technology. You can read more about our team and culture here - https://hatchways.io/careers.\n\n\nWhat we are looking for?\n\nWe are adding a Senior Full-stack Engineer to the team. As a member of the team, you will get a chance to develop complex web applications, using a mix of Javascript (React) and Python. You will be working in a highly collaborative environment. This is an exciting role for someone who enjoys the challenge and responsibility for large projects.\n\n\nWhat does senior mean? For us, we are a company that doesn’t hire based on years of experience or credentials. In order to be senior, we are looking for an engineer that can provide technical mentorship to our team and can work on complex technical projects with little to no direction.\n\n\nThe ideal candidate for this position is a thoughtful problem solver who can easily adapt to changing requirements and quickly learn new technologies. They are passionate about developing modern, cutting-edge web applications, and can balance empathy to end-users with technical requirements.\n\n\nWhat you hopefully bring:\n\nExperience with a modern front-end framework (React, Angular, Vue, Ember, Typescript) and back-end framework (Python, Rails, Node.js)\nOur stack is React, Python/Flask, GCP\nExperience with non-relational or relational databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra\nExperience working with IaaS such as GCP or AWS\nExperience giving feedback on others' code through code reviews\n\nAbout you:\n\nA positive attitude, motivated, and a fast learner\nYou love teamwork and find it easy to collaborate closely with the engineering team to solve complex problems in efficient and scalable ways\nYou have a passion for solving problems across all areas of the business\nExcited with the opportunity to lead a small team!\n\nInterview process:\n\nA 30-minute phone call with our CTO (https://www.linkedin.com/in/shumskassam/)\nA project-based assessment where you will work on a few issues on a Github repository - it will be very practical and done using React + Python\nA final 30-minute culture fit call with our CEO (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaclynling/)\n\nWhat are the perks and benefits?\n\nWe are a flexible, diverse, and remote-friendly team. We prioritize learning and growth opportunities for our developers (not only technically, but also personally) through frequent 1:1 meetings with your managers, valuable quarterly reviews, and external training opportunities. We are an early-stage startup, so joining us early means you will have a significant stake in the company. We also have a very flexible vacation and health benefits plan.\n\n\nLearn a little more about the founding team:\n\nHatchways is a Y Combinator-backed startup (S19) and is founded by two-time founders Jaclyn and Shums. Prior to starting Hatchways, Jaclyn and Shums started their first startup (Blynk, your personal stylist in your pocket) which got acquired by Kik (popular messenger app in Waterloo, ON). At Kik, Shums was an engineering manager and Jaclyn led product for the bots team. Together, they launched some of the first chatbots in the market with partners like H&M, Sephora, and Shopify. Shortly thereafter, they wanted to pursue a problem area they were passionate about: improving the education to employment pathways so more people have access to opportunities in tech.\n\n\nHatchways is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. If there is any part of the interview process that is not accommodating for your situation, we are more than happy to create a more comfortable process for you.
