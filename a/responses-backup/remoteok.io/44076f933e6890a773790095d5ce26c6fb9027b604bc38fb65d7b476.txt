and communicator, cooperative and always approach new challenges with a critical thinking mindset. You love collaborating with people from all disciplines and make sure to look at the big picture. You will succeed in our team if you want to take ownership of your work and operate well autonomously while being part of a tight-knit team. Efficient time management as well as eagerness to learn new skills and tools are something you value.\n\nRemote work and traveling ring your bell. A\u00a0culture of freedom and flexibility\u00a0makes you motivated and productive. You are a team player. Sound like you? Then, you'll fit right in!\n\nYou need to be based in Europe.\n\nThe salary is EUR 60,000 annually + benefits.\n\n**About the team\n\nToggl Hire is on a mission to revolutionize the way hiring happens. We are big believers that modern day recruiting should be effortless and enjoyable. That means no more resumes or cover letters, no more endless hours screening through applications, no more interpreting past roles into current experience.\n\nWe are a fully remote team, with headquarters in Tallinn, Estonia. Our people are highly skilled, highly motivated, and most importantly, a fun, friendly bunch.
