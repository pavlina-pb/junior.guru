technology. This means that we put people first and technology second. Our software solutions therefore not only facilitate administrative personnel processes. They stimulate professionals to make better use of the talents and potential of their employees. We strive for transparent communication, and for more influence, overview and involvement of flex workers and employees.\n\nThe basis of our codebase is three Ruby applications. We use Clojure for a number of supporting shared services. We increasingly notice that, based on user demand, there is a need to increase the coherence of functionalities, to offer the applications as one, and to place the mobile development on an equal footing with the web applications. Therefore, a slow shift is taking place in which GraphQL APIs are being built to serve React and React Native frontends. However, much of the business logic still remains in the Ruby applications, which are also being extended. We would like to add a Ruby Developer to our (remote) team to spar with and accelerate development.\n\n\n## Your team\n\nAs a Ruby Developer (remote), you are part of a close team and as a team you are responsible for our time registration and roster applications. You will study the domain and the applications, decide together with the team what the most added value is for the product and determine how it will be implemented and when it will be finished. This gives you a lot of freedom to determine what you put your energy into, but it also means that you have to be able to explain why you make a choice and why it will help us. You combine the creation of new features with the implementation of structural technical improvements.\n\nAt Nedap, we find it important that you learn from each other. You aim to achieve the best results as a team. That is why you have constructive discussions with your team about the pros and cons of various technical solutions. You are not afraid to ask questions and not too proud to change your point of view. You do not hesitate to give or receive feedback and you enjoy helping others along the way.\n\n\n## Our offer\n\nYou get a challenging position in a dynamic and international business. A job where you work together with peers using the newest techniques and where you get the full opportunity to develop yourself.

This means that we put people first and technology second. Our software solutions therefore not only facilitate administrative personnel processes. They stimulate professionals to make better use of the talents and potential of their employees. We strive for transparent communication, and for more influence, overview and involvement of flex workers and employees.\n\nThe basis of our codebase is three Ruby applications. We use Clojure for a number of supporting shared services. We increasingly notice that, based on user demand, there is a need to increase the coherence of functionalities, to offer the applications as one, and to place the mobile development on an equal footing with the web applications. Therefore, a slow shift is taking place in which GraphQL APIs are being built to serve React and React Native frontends. However, much of the business logic still remains in the Ruby applications, which are also being extended. We would like to add a Ruby Developer to our (remote) team to spar with and accelerate development.\n\n\n## Your team\n\nAs a Ruby Developer (remote), you are part of a close team and as a team you are responsible for our time registration and roster applications. You will study the domain and the applications, decide together with the team what the most added value is for the product and determine how it will be implemented and when it will be finished. This gives you a lot of freedom to determine what you put your energy into, but it also means that you have to be able to explain why you make a choice and why it will help us. You combine the creation of new features with the implementation of structural technical improvements.\n\nAt Nedap, we find it important that you learn from each other. You aim to achieve the best results as a team. That is why you have constructive discussions with your team about the pros and cons of various technical solutions. You are not afraid to ask questions and not too proud to change your point of view. You do not hesitate to give or receive feedback and you enjoy helping others along the way.\n\n\n## Our offer\n\nYou get a challenging position in a dynamic and international business. A job where you work together with peers using the newest techniques and where you get the full opportunity to develop yourself. At Nedap, you have the freedom to organize and shape your job in such a way that you can really make the difference and live up to your potential.\n\n\n## Required experience and skills\n\nYou recognize yourself in the following:\n* You have at least one year of experience with Ruby and other object-oriented programming languages;\n* You have a strong sense of responsibility;\n* You love diversity and disagreement, and are not afraid to ask questions;\n* Experience with Docker and distributed systems is a plus.	\n\nBe sure to mention the words **WONDER CRAWL HIGH** when applying to show you read the job post completely.
