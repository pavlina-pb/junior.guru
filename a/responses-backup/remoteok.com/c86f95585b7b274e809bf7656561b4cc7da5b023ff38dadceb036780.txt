We\u2019re a small yet globally distributed bunch of friendly music nerds who work part-time and full-time. In an average day at Cradle, you\u2019ll perform code-reviews, fix well-scoped bugs, help plan and scope larger features, and pair-program with existing team members. The Distribution side of Cradle Engineering is responsible for the website\/e-commerce, product distribution infrastructure, and the user and licensing APIs. The application stack consists of an API and an accounts service written in NodeJS, an integration with OpenID Connect for authentication, a Postgres backend, and a WordPress instance with some custom plugins. Our application has comprehensive test coverage, and we perform weekly releases from Heroku and WPEngine.\n\n**Ideally, you have:**\n- A few years of backend NodeJS development experience\n- Knowledge of different testing strategies, and opinions about what is appropriate when\n- Experience working in a remote, globally-distributed team with lots of asynchronous, written communication\n\n**You might\u2019ve also:**\n- Developed custom WordPress themes and plugins\n- Worked at music tech company, and\/or developed music tech in your free time\n- Implemented an asset pipeline for images or audio content\n- Contributed to open source\n- Been interested in the business side of a music tech company\n\n**Perks!**\n- Work when you want, as much as you want (as long as it\u2019s usually more than ~20 hours\/week)\n- Sign on as a 1099 contractor or W-2 employee, your choice!\n- Be part of an early-stage, non-VC funded startup with a healthy engineering culture and a sustainable growth plan\n- Work on something that isn\u2019t dystopian surveillance tech.

<div class="markdown">Cradle is a recently launched music tech startup looking for a Fullstack Developer. We’re a small yet globally distributed bunch of friendly music nerds who work part-time and full-time. In an average day at Cradle, you’ll perform code-reviews, fix well-scoped bugs, help plan and scope larger features, and pair-program with existing team members. The Distribution side of Cradle Engineering is responsible for the website/e-commerce, product distribution infrastructure, and the user and licensing APIs. The application stack consists of an API and an accounts service written in NodeJS, an integration with OpenID Connect for authentication, a Postgres backend, and a WordPress instance with some custom plugins. Our application has comprehensive test coverage, and we perform weekly releases from Heroku and WPEngine.\n\n**Ideally, you have:**\n- A few years of backend NodeJS development experience\n- Knowledge of different testing strategies, and opinions about what is appropriate when\n- Experience working in a remote, globally-distributed team with lots of asynchronous, written communication\n\n**You might’ve also:**\n- Developed custom WordPress themes and plugins\n- Worked at music tech company, and/or developed music tech in your free time\n- Implemented an asset pipeline for images or audio content\n- Contributed to open source\n- Been interested in the business side of a music tech company\n\n**Perks!**\n- Work when you want, as much as you want (as long as it’s usually more than ~20 hours/week)\n- Sign on as a 1099 contractor or W-2 employee, your choice!\n- Be part of an early-stage, non-VC funded startup with a healthy engineering culture and a sustainable growth plan\n- Work on something that isn’t dystopian surveillance tech. We sell an actual product (i.e. not user data).\n \n\nBe sure to mention the word **STUNNING** when applying to show you read the job post completely. This is a beta feature to avoid spam applicants. Companies can search these words to find applicants that read this and see they're human.\n\n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
