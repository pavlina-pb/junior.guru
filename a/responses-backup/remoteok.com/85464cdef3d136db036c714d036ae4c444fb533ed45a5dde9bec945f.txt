Learn more about the product on [https:\/\/simplepoll.rocks](https:\/\/simplepoll.rocks)\n- Wilhelm created Simple Poll in early 2016 to improve his own workflow when working in Slack. Started as a side project and then grew up to be a real company!\n- Simple Poll is one of the most popular apps for Slack and over the course of a year serves millions of users. As a member of the engineering team, you will be able to directly impact the experience of all of those users.\n- We are a fairly early stage company with a small and growing team. We're profitable, bootstrapped (no external investment) and very much plan to stay that way!\n\nBecause we\u2019re such a small team, you will be able to have a massive impact. Not just on Simple Poll the product and its millions of users but also on the company, our culture, and our day to day collaboration. \n\nFrom an engineering perspective Simple Poll can often feel similar to building an API. Slack apps work largely by receiving JSON payloads from Slack, making API calls to the Slack API, and then returning some JSON back to Slack. As such, our engineering work tends to be very backend-heavy and although we do have a web dashboard, writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is more rare.\n\nIn our day to day work we face an interesting set of evolving engineering and product challenges:\n\n- One such challenge is dealing creatively with the constraints of the Slack platform. Since Simple Poll exists almost entirely within Slack, we are bound by many of the constraints and extension capabilities of the Slack platform, such as the block kit framework ([https:\/\/api.slack.com\/block-kit](https:\/\/api.slack.com\/block-kit)). A powerful set of tools is available to us, but the path to bringing a feature to life is sometimes not as straightforward as it seems.\n- We also constantly face trade offs between making Simple Poll more powerful (and implementing a long list of customer feature requests) while simultaneously maintaining and improving the simplicity that out customers love. Finding a good balance is important here and often we find that there is a way to achieve both capability and simplicity.\n- Slack is also constantly evolving and it is our responsibility to keep up with this evolution to ensure that Simple Poll works no matter what Slack context users find themselves in. Recent wide-reaching changes have been the introduction of Slack Enterprise Grid (multiple Slack workspace under the same umbrella) and Slack Connect (shared channels between different Slack workspaces). These changes make it more challenging to model Slack entities like users and channels \u2013 if you\u2019re curious to learn more about this problem, check out this blog post: [https:\/\/wilhelmklopp.com\/posts\/slack-database-modelling\/](https:\/\/wilhelmklopp.com\/posts\/slack-database-modelling\/)\n\n### Remote\n\nWe are remote-first with folks across Canada, the UK, and Germany \ud83c\udf05\u00a0 We love and embrace remote working (and have done so even in pre-pandemic times).

<div class="markdown"># Senior Software Engineer (Full Stack)\n\n## Simple Poll\n\nFull Time – Remote\n\n\n# About Simple Poll\n\n- Simple Poll brings polls and surveys natively into Slack. Learn more about the product on [https://simplepoll.rocks](https://simplepoll.rocks)\n- Wilhelm created Simple Poll in early 2016 to improve his own workflow when working in Slack. Started as a side project and then grew up to be a real company!\n- Simple Poll is one of the most popular apps for Slack and over the course of a year serves millions of users. As a member of the engineering team, you will be able to directly impact the experience of all of those users.\n- We are a fairly early stage company with a small and growing team. We're profitable, bootstrapped (no external investment) and very much plan to stay that way!\n\nBecause we’re such a small team, you will be able to have a massive impact. Not just on Simple Poll the product and its millions of users but also on the company, our culture, and our day to day collaboration. \n\nFrom an engineering perspective Simple Poll can often feel similar to building an API. Slack apps work largely by receiving JSON payloads from Slack, making API calls to the Slack API, and then returning some JSON back to Slack.
