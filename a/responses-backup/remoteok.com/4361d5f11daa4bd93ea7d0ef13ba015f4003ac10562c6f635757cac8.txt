Thus we still run a moderate cloud stack on the Google Cloud Platform. As you can see in the description of our stack, we use Hashicorp's tools for deployment. That means a Consul + Vault cluster, and Nomad to schedule (container) jobs. That actually runs stable without too much maintenance. Most of the work is in improving the experience of other developers, and making it easier for them to do the things they need to do on the operations side.\n\nFor example, we use Terraform to control and set up our resources. However that doesn't mean that it is clear for everyone what to use and how to tie that together. Modularizing and documenting is key here. Also, we want to enable continuous integration here, so everyone can see what the effect would be of their changes, without giving everyone the necessary credentials to the whole stack.\n\nThe rest of the team will look to you for advice on how to deploy their service, how to keep sight on its metrics and errors. Note that you are probably the one with the most knowledge, we do rotate on-call duties with the whole team.\n\n\n**Compensation**\nThe envisioned salary range for this position is \u20ac55k-\u20ac70k per year (excluding 8% holiday pay), depending on experience. Besides that we offer Stock Appreciation Rights and a 4% learning budget. You\u2019ll get an Apple Macbook Pro (M1) to work on.\n\n\n**About You**\nAs important as coding itself however is your attitude towards colleagues and learning. We are looking for someone who is eager to improve, not too shy to ask any type of question and who can communicate well in writing. The reason for this is that we work remotely a lot (we did quite so before corona, but now practically 100%).\n\nYou are eager to solve complex problems in a sustainable and pragmatic way. You don\u2019t shy away from calling out possible pitfalls or infeasible plans. On the other hand you are also solution oriented, and helpful towards people who don\u2019t understand code.\n\nMore information on who we are and what we do can be found [here](https:\/\/engineering.solarmonkey.nl\/jobs\/2021-11-platform-lead\/#_details).\n Apply now and work remotely at Solar Monkey",
