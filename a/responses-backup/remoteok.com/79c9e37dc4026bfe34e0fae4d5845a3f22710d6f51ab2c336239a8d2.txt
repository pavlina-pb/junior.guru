It isn\u2019t. But as the world has gotten more connected and digitized, commercial insurance lags \u2014 creating a fragmented landscape where businesses, agents, and insurance companies struggle to interact in a smooth and easy way. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built a highly efficient exchange that cuts the friction out of commercial insurance by connecting everyone to the right quote in record time.\n\nPowering the world of insurance is no small feat, so we\u2019ve built a team that's incredibly talented and passionate about our potential to upgrade the entire industry. As more and more companies, big and small, depend on our technology to operate in the commercial insurance space, we\u2019ll need the best talent all around to support our growth.
