Are you looking for an international and fast-paced, yet collaborative and inclusive environment to thrive in?\n\nYou have come to the right place.\n\nCitizenLab, a global social impact scale-up with its HQ in Brussels, and presence in London, works to make public decision-making more participatory, inclusive, and responsive. The SaaS platform is already being used by 300+ local governments and organisations in over 18 countries, facilitating two-way communication between governments and their residents. Since it was founded in 2015, CitizenLab has given 750,000+ community members a direct voice in local politics, has earned recognition as the 'Best Social Impact Startup in Europe', and was featured in outlets such as The New York Times and Forbes.\n\nCitizenLab is looking for purpose-driven talent to join us on our mission to enable millions of people in cities across the globe to shape the future of their communities.\n\n**Product Designer (Insights)**\n\nAs a Product Designer in the&nbsp;**Insights squad**, you play a key role in shaping our new Community Insights product,&nbsp;**helping policy-makers better listen to their community**. You help&nbsp;**create solutions**&nbsp;that make sure every voice is heard by processing and analyzing unstructured input generated by the community to better inform public decisions.\n\nYou are a member of the cross-functional Insights squad, with a Product Manager and five Engineers. We have clear objectives in terms of product outcome, and the autonomy to make them happen. You work closely together with the squad throughout the whole product discovery and delivery process. In this role, you will report to the team lead of the Product team.\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\n* Together with your squad, internal stakeholders, and end users, you&nbsp;**work out different concepts**&nbsp;for the problems researched by the product manager;\n\n* You use research techniques to&nbsp;**inform your design decisions**, and leverage tools such as wireframes, sketches, and&nbsp;**live-data prototypes**&nbsp;to test and&nbsp;**improve product experience**&nbsp;in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders;\n\n* You design components, interactions, and transitions in Figma and you thoroughly&nbsp;**test**&nbsp;the usability of the solution with real users and real data;\n\n* Together with other product designers and front-end engineers at CitizenLab, you continuously raise the bar in terms of&nbsp;**design quality**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**process efficiency**.\n\n**What do we expect from you?**\n\n* You have at least 2 years experience designing digital products that combine, process, analyse and summarise high volumes of data. You are able to translate data into stunning&nbsp;**data visualizations**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**dashboards**&nbsp;that convey the information in a clear way. Experience with working with unstructured textual data is considered a big plus.\n\n* You are very proficient working in&nbsp;**Figma**, and feel comfortable using libraries such as&nbsp;**D3**&nbsp;for data visualization. Experience with designing&nbsp;**NLP\/AI**-aided data tools is considered a plus.\n\n* You enjoy participating in the entire&nbsp;**product development process**, from problem solving and system modelling, through to detailed UI, visual, and interaction design.\n\n* You have a willingness to&nbsp;**own problems**&nbsp;and are comfortable with&nbsp;**ambiguity**.\n\n* You have experience with both&nbsp;**qualitative and quantitative techniques**&nbsp;for&nbsp;**user testing**. And you find answers to your questions in&nbsp;**data**.\n\n* You are&nbsp;**proactively asking for feedback and input**&nbsp;from stakeholders. You expose your work early on, and have no trouble killing your darlings.\n\n* You understand what it takes to effectively&nbsp;**collaborate**&nbsp;with both product management and engineering, and you are an excellent&nbsp;**communicator**. Any hands-on experience writing code can be a plus.\n\n* You are very fluent in&nbsp;**English**. Knowledge of Dutch and\/or French is a plus.\n\n* The ability to relocate to&nbsp;**Brussels**&nbsp;is a nice-to-have, but not a requirement at all.\n\n**What can you expect from us?**\n\n* Unlock your full potential and create social&nbsp;**impact at scale**. Day-to-day, we work with local government leaders across the world to help them connect with their communities.\n\n* Become a key factor in our rapid transition from a startup to a&nbsp;**scaleup**&nbsp;(50 employees), and our international expansion.\n\n* Work in a&nbsp;**fast-paced, collaborative, and supportive**&nbsp;environment. We share a participatory culture of autonomy and ownership by everyone, not only by leadership.\n\n* Be part of our&nbsp;**dynamic, international team**. We are as serious about our work in digital democracy as we are about having fun on our journey together.\n\n* Enjoy an&nbsp;**informal work vibe**&nbsp;with open communication and full transparency on results.\n\n* Participate in our various hybrid (in-person\/remote)&nbsp;**team events**, inspiring team lunches, our company book club, bi-quarterly strategic town halls, and yearly global team retreats.\n\n* Spend 10% of your time on&nbsp;**personal projects and self-development**&nbsp;for the long run.
