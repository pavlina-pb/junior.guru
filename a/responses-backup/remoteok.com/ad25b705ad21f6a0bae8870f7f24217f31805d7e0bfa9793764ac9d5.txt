January 2020 that is building the future of digital communications\non top of the world's most ubiquitous messaging platform \u2014 email. We're on a\n[mission](https:\/\/www.shortwave.com\/blog\/future-of-messaging\/) to ensure that\neveryone has access to high quality, decentralized, and secure messaging.\n\nWe have an experienced team distributed across the US, with almost half of our team located\nin California. Our CEO Andrew formerly cofounded [Firebase](https:\/\/firebase.google.com\/) (later acquired by Google), and much of our early team met\nAndrew while working there building the infrastructure behind millions of today's mobile and web apps.\n\nOur first product is a brand new inbox experience for Gmail that keeps your inbox organized by default.\nWe believe that email should prioritize people, not advertising, getting through your inbox shouldn't\nrequire busywork, and sending an email should be as fast as typing a text message.
